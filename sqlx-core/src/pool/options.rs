/// Configuration options for [`Pool`][super::Pool].
///
/// ### Callback Functions: Why Do I Need `Box::pin()`?
/// Essentially, because it's impossible to write generic bounds that describe a closure
/// with a higher-ranked lifetime parameter, returning a future with that same lifetime.
///
/// Ideally, you could define it like this:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// async fn takes_foo_callback(f: impl for<'a> Fn(&'a mut Foo) -> impl Future<'a, Output = ()>)
/// ```
///
/// However, the compiler does not allow using `impl Trait` in the return type of an `impl Fn`.
///
/// And if you try to do it like this:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// async fn takes_foo_callback<F, Fut>(f: F)
/// where
///     F: for<'a> Fn(&'a mut Foo) -> Fut,
///     Fut: for<'a> Future<Output = ()> + 'a
/// ```
///
/// There's no way to tell the compiler that those two `'a`s should be the same lifetime.
///
/// It's possible to make this work with a custom trait, but it's fiddly and requires naming
///  the type of the closure parameter.
///
/// Having the closure return `BoxFuture` allows us to work around this, as all the type information
/// fits into a single generic parameter.
///
/// We still need to `Box` the future internally to give it a concrete type to avoid leaking a type
/// parameter everywhere, and `Box` is in the prelude so it doesn't need to be manually imported,
/// so having the closure return `BoxFuture` directly is the path of least resistance from the
/// perspective of both API designer and consumer.
